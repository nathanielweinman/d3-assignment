# INFO 247 D3 Assignment

You will build the code over 5 steps:

1. Find a set of data and format it like the example "data.csv". Try not to have too many points (10-20 would be good).
2. Create a static scatter plot for a single year.
3. Color the points on the scatter plot.
4. Animate the points to cycle through years.
5. Add any other styling you wish. Please be creative!

Example images are included.

# Step 5 Modifications
1. Opacity changes gradually while looping through years. In a larger visualizations, opacity can be good for representing discrete, continuous values (particularly with so few like 4), so this felt like a fun styling to apply.
2. Transition movements are different between the Normal and Chaotic points. The normal points move efficiently, moving at a constant speed and in a straight line to their next destination. The Chaotic points first moving horizontally, then vertically. Additionally, they have a more agressive easing style.

Also, the Normal points nicely create a rectangle, where the chaotic points were randomly generated.
